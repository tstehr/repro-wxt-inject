<h1>Demo for a problem with wxt injected main world scripts</h1>
<p>This page create a function in
  <code>window.injected</code>
  which is run in an interval. It simply writes to the element below to indicate that it has run.</p>
<p>When wxt injects a page script called "injected", this interferes with the function run. You should also see an error in the
developer console.</p>
<output>
  ❌ The function has not yet run
</output>
